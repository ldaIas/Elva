# Elva

**Elva** is a new programming language inspired by Elm and the Java ecosystem, designed for purity, simplicity, and powerful effect management. It aims to bring modern functional programming ideas to the JVM world with an easy-to-use, reliable runtime.

---

## Project Goals

- **Purity First**: Every function is pure by default. No hidden side effects.
- **Explicit Effects**: All side effects are modeled and managed through a clean effect system.
- **Strong Static Typing**: No `null`. Clear, enforced types.
- **Lazy Effect Execution**: Effects are handled lazily by the runtime.
- **Simple, Practical Syntax**: Inspired by Elm, but adapted for general-purpose use.
- **Seamless Java Interop**: Designed to easily call Java libraries when needed.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Purpose**: Represents the application's state (similar to Elm's `Model`).
- **View**: Defines how the Purpose is presented to the user (CLI, GUI, etc.).
- **Update**: Handles `Messages` to transform the Purpose.
- **Effect Machine**: Effects are described, not performed directly. The runtime manages them.
- **Superpose**: Special type to handle multiple superposed instances, opening paths for innovative concurrent designs.

## Example (Proposed Syntax)

```elva
from elva.std.iofx import =
    Debug

/**
 * The purpose is a special `record` that tells us what the program _is_.
 * This acts as the main function.
 * It tells us what the internal state will be (model) and how that will be presented to users (surface) as well as how to handle signals.
 * The purpose type has special definitions:
 * - `model` must be a record (normal)
 * - `surface` must be a special decalared `surface` definition that is typed by the purpose (Counter here)
 * - `update` must be a function that conforms to the updateInterface: takes in a `record` and `msg` and produces a record in the same shape as the input
                Must take in the same msg type as the surface
 */
purpose Counter =
    { model: CounterModel
    , surface: CounterSurface
    , update: update
    }

/**
 * msg is a special type that denotes the message signals the app will need to handle. Very similar to Elm's `type`
 * This msg tells whether we should increment or decrement the current counter, or if the last input was InvalidInput
 */
msg CounterMsg
    = Increment
    | Decrement
    | InvalidInput

/**
 * Basic model that is created by a record. This is similar to `type alias` in Elm
 * records have overrideable methods (denoted by +) that are otherwise provided by the language by default
 * This record keeps track of the current count in the counter app model
 */
record CounterModel =
    { count : Int
    
    + init = CounterModel 0 // Could also do CounterModel(0) or {count = 0}
    }


/**
 * A surface is a way of presenting or "feeling" the model. It is typed by the Purpose and Message types.
 * The update function must use the same Message type the surface does
 * Basic surface for Counter purposes that displays the current count to the shell, and asks for user input via stdin
 */
surface CounterSurface P: Counter, M: CounterMsg =
    { view = \counterModel -> SimpleShellOut ("Current count is" ++ counterModel.count) // SimpleShellout is standard library renderer. eq to {outStr = "..."}
    , events = [ SimpleShellIn "Enter command: increment(i, +) or decrement(d, -)" 
                               \userInput -> case String.lower(userInput) of: 
                                   "+", "i" -> Increment
                                   "-", "d" -> Decrement
                                   _ -> InvalidInput
               ]   
    }

/**
 * Function to update the model. Takes in a model and outputs a new model. Typed by the Message
 * Note the parans () are not necessary. If there was only one input it'd look like `fn update inModel: Model |-> Model`
 * This function updates the model by adding or subtracting based on the input.
 */
fn update (inModel: CounterModel, inMsg: CounterMsg) |-> (CounterModel, List Effect) =
    case inMsg of:
        Increment -> (inModel | count = current + 1 // This line is shorthand to create a new CounterModel using the same values as inModel
                                                    // while updating the "count" field to be the current "count" field's value + 1.
                                                    // "current" is shorthand for referencing the field on the LHS of assignment in the input record.
                                                    // would be like `CurrentModel (inModel.count + 1)` or `inModel | count = inModel.count + 1`
                      , [ Debug "Increment pressed. Current model is " ++ inModel ] )
        Decrement -> (inModel | count = current - 1, Debug "Decrement pressed. Current model is " ++ inModel)
        InvalidInput -> (inModel, [ Debug "Invalid input entered, nothing done" ]) 
```

## Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

Elva is currently in early development.  
We're starting with a basic interpreter/runtime in Kotlin targeting the JVM, focusing on file I/O, console output, and pure update/message loops.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin** - Language for the initial implementation
- **Gradle** - Build and dependency management
- **JVM** - Target runtime

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  
More details and a roadmap will be posted once the core runtime is stable.

If you're interested early, feel free to open an issue or a discussion.
